//! R5: the monitor's guarantees (plan §4; Theorem `thm:matcher` at the level of `Validator`).
//!
//! A `Validator` is read through `ValidatorView`: the rules passed to `add_rule`, in order, and
//! the committed history (oldest first). `check_step` is the meaning of one `check` against the
//! state before it, `check_frame` what it does to the state; `trace_safe` is the invariant they
//! preserve. All three are stated with R2's `policy_permits` and `least_violation` over events.
//! The guarantee is conditional on R4's `event_obligations::<E>()` where the contracts say so:
//! the compiled rules' hash containers are trusted only for faithful keys.
