# Audit fixes status

Base: main `7050ac3df9ed7594bb2d1635f4bd39d89bb4a3a4`; task and evidence read from handoff/audit-fixes `88c9774445f090c3fdecd876e2450ac3c0b0912b`.

Concurrent work: explicitly reported by user. This worker uses isolated `/tmp/junco-audit`; other workers' changes must not be overwritten or assigned inferred intent. Remote inspection found no fix/audit-* branch and no open audit-fix PR at initial check. No item is claimed completed without gate evidence.

| Item | State | Evidence / public statements |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | in progress | Strengthened `counterexample_spec` and added `undeclared_capacity` in `crates/history-analysis/src/spec/analyzer.rs`; reconstructed instance bridge verifies. Reviewer target running; added attempt A's declared-coordinate-zero lemma after inbox message. Branch fix/audit-h1. |

Merged items: none. PR numbers and merge commits: none.

Verification: H1 library merge gate `history-analysis --no-default-features --features runtime,std`: **603 verified, 0 errors**. Ghost-erased clippy passed (`--all-targets -- -D warnings`); package tests **27 passed**. Final package fmt passed after removing the throwaway smoke example. Runtime smoke observed counterexample candidate `[Constant(C0(3)), Constant(C1(7))]`, empty history, both coordinates declared; concrete `(3,7), []` refutes All ⊆ Empty. Reviewer gate still running. No ensures weakened; no trusted items added; no paper or benchmark edits.

Toolchain: downloaded pinned Z3 cannot execute on host glibc 2.31. Existing `/ssd0/zkent/junco-proof-tools/compat-verus` and `z3-compat` pass the script's pinned version checks; these are used for verification.

Inbox: acknowledged **2026-11-13: Port H1 and H6 from attempt A (PR #12) first**, fetched at handoff `cb24ee9`. Read A's reviewer source at `c441afd`; H1 has equivalent slot-domain exclusion and the declared-coordinate-zero lemma. H6 now precedes H3/H4/H5. No other A changes will be imported; no merge/rebase onto A. Initial inbox was empty. Poll at every gate and at least every 30 minutes; vacuity messages preempt all work.

Delivery uses one branch/PR per item into main, and this separate status branch, as requested by user (superseding handoff's integration-PR instructions).
